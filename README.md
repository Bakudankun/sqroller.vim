# sqroller.vim

This is a Vim9 plugin that adds scrollbars to the leftmost column of each
window. Basic mouse interaction is supported.

To achieve this, sqroller.vim enables 'foldcolumn' and creates popup windows
that overlap them. You can't see foldcolumns anymore, but I thought that's
fine.

See the [help doc](./doc/sqroller.txt) for details.
